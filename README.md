# Features

Data Analysis: Explore descriptive statistics of the training dataset.
Patient Data Input: Use sliders to input health parameters for predicting diabetes.
Visualizations: Visualize patient data compared to the overall dataset.
Machine Learning Model: Utilizes a Random Forest Classifier for predicting diabetes.
Separate Calculations: Sidebar functionality for calculating BMI and Diabetes Pedigree independently.
BMI and Diabetes Pedigree Graphs: Interactive graphs showcasing the relationship between age and health parameters.
User Report: Display the prediction result and accuracy.

# Instructions

Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the application with streamlit run app.py.
Interact with the web app through the browser.

# Usage

Adjust health parameters using the sliders.
Explore visualizations for better insights.
Receive instant predictions for diabetes.
Use the sidebar for separate BMI and Diabetes Pedigree calculations.

# Dataset

The web app uses a diabetes dataset (diabetes.csv) for training the machine learning model. The dataset includes various health parameters and an outcome column indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.
